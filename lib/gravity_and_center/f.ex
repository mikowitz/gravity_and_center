# Notes:
# Total: ~3'15"
# "nothing" is a long silence. longest in the piece, or at least since the opening
# after that, similar to the beginning, solo on a single pitch, like A and C but with a bit more background
# "sound of water poured into a bowl" - airy sounds with a bit of pitch? multis based on mapping of alphabet to sax keys?
# actually use water bowls? (without being twee)
