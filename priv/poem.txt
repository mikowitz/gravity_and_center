I'm sorry I cannot say I love you when you say
you love me. The words, like moist fingers,
appear before me FULL OF PROMISE but then run away
to A NARROW BLACK ROOM THAT IS ALWAYS DARK,
where they are silent, elegant, like antique gold,
devouring the thing I feel. I want the force
of attraction to crush the force of repulsion
and my inner and outer worlds to pierce
one another, LIKE A HORSE WHIPPED BY A MAN.
I don't want words to sever me from reality.
I don't want to need them. I WANT NOTHING
to reveal feeling but feelingâ€”as in freedom,
or the knowledge of peace in a realm beyond,
OR THE SOUND OF WATER POURED IN A BOWL.
